- Compute and Storage is a unit of [NBIS](https://nbis.se/), the national bioinformatics support infrastructure and a SciLifeLab platform, and is hosted by UPPMAX.
    
## UPPMAX missions
- Mission for NAISS: to provide a quality high-performance computing environment nationally
  - General purpose: Rackham
  - Data intensive. Rackham/Bianca
  - Sensitive data (human sequences): Bianca
- Mission for UU: to provide relevant services to Uppsala University
  - For UU researchers and education: Snowy cluster
- Mission for NBIS/SciLifeLab: to provide the best possible environment for data-driven life science, especially bioinformatics

## UPPMAX support staff

- System experts
  - Hardware and system
- Application experts
  - software and usage
  - compute and storage project allocations
  - user accounts

## The Application experts not dealing with allocation and accounts

- Transfer HPC competence
  - intro courses like this
- Transfer computational know-how within the respective fields
  - Physics, chemistry, bioinformatics, geoscience, coding
  - [About the application-experts](https://www.uppmax.uu.se/about-us/application-experts/)
- In other words:
  - installing software,
  - troubleshooting,
  - general advice,
  - possibly make jobs more efficient.
